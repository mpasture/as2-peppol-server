A demo AS2 server to easily receive AS2 messages from PEPPOL.
This project is only meant as a demo project for illustrative purposes, on how to
implement a PEPPOL AS2 server. This server implementation writes all incoming documents to disc and does not do anything else with them! Additional or different logic must be implemented!

This AS2 server is based on my **[as2-lib](https://github.com/phax/as2-lib)** library, as well as on **[as2-peppol-servlet](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-servlet)**, **[peppol-commons](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons)** and **[ph-ubl](https://github.com/phax/ph-ubl)**.
A client to send messages to this server is [as2-peppol-client](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-client).

#Project structure
This project is a Java 1.6+ web application and as such meant to be used in an application
server (like Tomcat, Jetty etc.).

It consists of the following major components:
  * A specialized servlet for retrieval: `com.helger.peppol.as2server.servlet.MyAS2PeppolReceiveServlet` which defines the path to the AS2 server configuration file. The default path is `as2-server-data/as2-server-config.xml`. The servlet is referenced from `WEB-INF/web.xml`.
  * The main handler for an incoming SBDH document in class `com.helger.peppol.as2server.handler.AS2IncomingSBDHandler`. This class is referenced via the default SPI lookup mechanism (see `META-INF/services/`).
  * Additionally a configuration file `as2-server-data\as2-server-config.xml` is provided that defines the AS2 specific setup. The details on the configuration file can be found at the **[as2-peppol-servlet](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-servlet)** project.
  
#Before you start
Before this project can be run in a useful way a PKCS12 keystore with your PEPPOL AP certificate must be provided. By default the keystore must be located in `as2-server-data\server-certs.p12` and must have the password `peppol`. To change this edit the `<certificates>` element in the `as2-server-config.xml` file.

Btw. you need no database to run this server. If you want one just use one - but you don't need to. 

#Run it
The easiest way to run and debug the application is to execute class `com.helger.peppol.as2server.jetty.RunInJettyPEPPOLAS2` from within your IDE (as a standard Java application). It starts up a minimal server and listens on port 8080. The servlet that receives PEPPOL messages listens to path `/as2/` and supports only HTTP method POST.
After startup locate your browser to `http://localhost:8080` to check if it is running.

#Test it
Now that the AS2 server is running you may have a closer look at my **[as2-peppol-client](https://github.com/phax/as2-peppol-client)** project which lets you send AS2 messages to a server.
If both client and server are configured correctly a successful message exchange should be easily possible.
